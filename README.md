## Architecture

I have used a hexagonal style architecture. Where I have divided the functional components in the `components` folder, the common `hooks` in its folder, and in the `core` folder, I have added the related to the API calls.

I have used the mantine component library, but I have not used anything related to state management, because I have not found it necessary.
